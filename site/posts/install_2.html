<p>If you want to have comments on some or all of your blog pages, you have to configure 11ty Frame your commenting system: each page where comments are useful must be paired with a Github issue which you have to create as soon as the page is published.
A simple convention is to give the “comment” issue the same title as your page file name.</p>
<p>The issue number in your Github repository related to your page has to be declared in its front matter with the property <code>gh_issue_n</code>.</p>
